# BabyName
In this project, I compared different baby names’ popularity over time, using data (csv files) on the popularity of different baby names in the United States from 1880 to 2014 (acquired from Coursera). The data files give information on the first names of people (both boys and girls) born in a particular year.
This project has the following functions:
  1.Calculates the number of total births in one or several years by reading one or several.csv files; and count the number of girls names, the number of boys names and the total baby names.
  2.Gets the rank of the baby name for the given gender (F or M) in a year, where rank 1 represents the name with the largest number of births. If the name is not found, then -1 is the answer.
  3.Shows the name for the given gender (F or M) in a year for a specific rank number. If the rank number does not found in the file, then “NO NAME” is the answer.
  4.Transfers a name, which identifies what name would have been named if the baby were born in a different year, based on the same popularity (same rank).
  5.Choose the year with the highest rank for a specific name and given gender (F or M) among different years.
  6.Computes the average rank of a specific name and given gender (F or M) over several years.
  7.Obtains the total number of births of those names with the same gender and same year who are ranked higher than a specific name.
